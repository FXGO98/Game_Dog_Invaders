# Game_Peepee_Attack
Game similar to the 70s arcade game, known as Space Invaders, but with a goofy soundtrack and goofy characters. Game built from Pygame.


RULES AND CONTROLS:

You can control the spaceship with the arrow keys and shoot a bullet against the enemy by pressing space bar.

The more enemies you kill, the faster they will move. And they always respawn.

However unlike space invaders the player can move all over the scenario, and he will not lose if the enemy reach the planet.

When an enemy reach the bottom of the scenario he will keep move upwards.

The player will lose if 3 enemies reach the bottom, or if the ship collides with the enemy and explodes.

You can lower the number of enemies that reached the bottom by 1 if you kill 20 enemies after that.

The player wins the game and therefore saves the planet if he can reach at least 100 point of score and if none of the dogs reached the planet or at least if those who reached were already "compensated (read the previous paragraph)".

Have fun and try hard.
